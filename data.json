      "useTo": "Unload the weapon. Run 3-4 patches soaked in CLP through the barrel. Make 10-15 passes with a brush\nsoaked in CLP. Run 3-4 patches soaked in CLP through the barrel until they come out clean.\nAfter that, run 1-2 dry patches. Clean all exposed surfaces with CLP patches. Remove the lubricant\nfrom wooden surfaces. In case of persistent dirt, use special cleaning agents from the DayPatron line.\nFor long-term storage or under unfavorable conditions, use Rust Protection from the DayPatron line.",
